# Introduction

**Rio de Janeiro** is recognized as a wonderful city and there are several attractions for tourists. The metropolitan area is usually selected as a major travel destination, however outside the capital there are interesting places to visit.

The purpose of this study is to select a location in the state of Rio de Janeiro in order to rent a vacation home. The main selected locations are not in the state capital, but include the region of the lakes (*Lagos*), mountains (*Serrana*) and *Bahia da Ilha Grande*.

---
# Data

Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE in Portuguese) data were used to **identify spatial coordinates**. Foursquare data will also be used to **identify the main resources of cities**.

---
# Methodology

In order to segment the locations, **Kmeans** was used. An **unsupervised machine learning technique** that can help us verify what **similarities** exist between locations. The variables used to analyze the similarities of these regions were the **venues** extracted from the proximity with the spatial coordinates provided for each region.

# Results

The full list from regions to analysis is below

# Results

Following is the map with all locations

# Discussion

Seven clusters were selected. Clusters 1 and 6 are the ones that added more localities. They are clusters that concentrate the most visited cities in these selected regions.

### Cluster 1

- In Abraão there are a lot of options of **hotels ans hostels**, you can stay there by **little money**. There are also good beach options.
- Arraial do Cabo is a great place. There is wonderful beaches and there may be more cheaper than Cabo Frio and Búzios (nearby places).

Cluster 1 there are more locations near a beach and can be more cheaper than locations in cluster 6

# Discussion

### Cluster 6

- Paraty was interesting because it contains diverse places, such as: beach, historic places, bookstores.
- To get a european experience in Brazil, Petrópolis is a nice place to go. Chocolate shop and German Restaurante as main options.
- Cabo Frio and Búzios are great places, but they are very expensive.

Cluster 6 has higher cost locations, such as restaurants specializing in international dishes.

The other places, by the my experience look less interesting to visit.

---
# Conclusion

Really, Rio de Janeiro is an excellent place, with several options: from the beach or the mountains. There are places for all tastes. Even very interesting places you can spend a lot less money.
